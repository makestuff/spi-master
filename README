------------------------------ SERIAL I/O MODULE -------------------------------

SPI-like serial I/O module. You clock a byte in in parallel using data_in and
load_in. The busy_out goes high whilst the bits are clocked out and in one at a
time. When it's finished, the serial input is available on data_out on the first
rising edge of the clock after busy_out goes low.
