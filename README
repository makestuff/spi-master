------------------------------ SPI MASTER MODULE -------------------------------

SPI master serial I/O module, with data-valid-ready interface. You put a byte to
be sent in the "send" pipe and a few cycles later the byte that was meanwhile
received becomes available on the "recv" pipe. This should be consumed
immediately otherwise the send pipe will block (i.e no more bytes will be sent
until the recieved byte is consumed).
